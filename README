libtcod-d is a set of bindings for using the excellent 
libtcod ( http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/ ) in the D programming language.

The DLL (libtcod.so on Linux, libtcod.dll on Windows) is dynamically loaded
on start up, not linked at compile time. Note that this means that on Linux
you must link with libdl by adding -ldl to your linking command to ensure
that your program runs.

The DMD 1 and 2 are supported, using Phobos. This means Tango/LDC is as of
yet unsupported, sorry. GDC is not supported, but it may work depending
on what you do. As far as I can recall, the sample module isn't compiling
with GDC (even goshawk's branch) at the moment.

To try the sample, run make -f makefile-d-sample on Linux, or run 
build_sample.bat on Windows.

The bindings are a strict port of the C API, so refer to libtcod 
documentation for more details. If I can get motivated, an object
wrapper that would be similar to the C++ API may be forthcoming, so watch
this space.
